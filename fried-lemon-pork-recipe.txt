Ingredients

500g Pork shoulder steaks
Olive oil for frying
Juice of three lemons

Method

Chop the shoulder steaks into 2cm cubes.  Put them in a saucpan, pour boiling water over them, bring back to the boil and then simmer for 20 mins.

Drain the pork cubes.  Put 1 tbsp of olive oil in a frying pan and heat until the oil starts to shimmer and the pork and stir fry until the edges of the pork cubes start to brown - especially any fatty bits.  Pour over the lemon juice and reduce the heat so that lemon juice is simmering.  Cook for about 20 minutes, stirring regularly until all of the liquid has gone and the pork is crispy and brown on the outside.
